# Overview

- Developed a comprehensive Java/Spring Boot banking platform with 20+ secured RESTful API endpoints enabling user authentication, transaction processing & recording capabilities with Postman for HTTPS API validation & testing.

- Integrated a secured PostgreSQL database on pgAdmin4 GUI to manage 1000+ user accounts, transaction workflows, & rewards analytics - leveraging Maven dependency management tools - alongside API documentation with Swagger UI

# Key Features

- **Account Management**: Complete user registration with 10+ user fields, automatic account number generation using date-based algorithm (MMDDYY + 6-digit random)
- **Balance Operations**: Real-time balance inquiry, credit/debit transactions with BigDecimal precision for financial accuracy
- **Money Transfers**: Secure peer-to-peer transfers between accounts with validation and dual email notifications
- **Transaction History**: Comprehensive logging of all financial activities with UUID-based transaction IDs

### Security & Authentication

- **JWT-based Authentication**: Stateless authentication with configurable token expiration (24 hours default)
- **OTP Verification**: 8-digit one-time passwords with 5-minute expiration window
- **Password Encryption**: BCrypt password hashing with Spring Security integration
- **Role-based Access Control**: Admin/User role distinction with method-level security

### Communication & Documentation

- **Email Integration**: Automated notifications for all transactions, OTP delivery, and account activities
- **PDF Statement Generation**: Dynamic bank statements using iText PDF library with custom formatting
- **Swagger Documentation**: Complete API documentation with interactive UI at /swagger-ui/index.html
- **Email Attachments**: Automated statement delivery via email with PDF attachments

### Data Management

- **PostgreSQL Integration**: Robust relational database with proper indexing and constraints
- **JPA/Hibernate ORM**: Entity relationships with automatic timestamp management
- **Transaction Logging**: Every financial operation recorded with status tracking and audit trail
