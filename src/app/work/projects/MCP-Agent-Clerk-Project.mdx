title: "Bookmark Manager w/ MCP Agent & Clerk Authentication Integration"
publishedAt: "2025-04-07"
summary: "• Developed a **Next.js/TypeScript** bookmark management platform with **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** integration, enabling **AI** assistants like **Cursor** to programmatically interact with user data through **authenticated API tools** for application management


• Implemented **OAuth 2.0** authentication flow using **Clerk's MCP tools** with **15 discovery endpoints**, securing user data isolation through **token verification** while maintaining **SQLite/Prisma** database operations for **multi-user** bookmark storage and management"

## Overview

This project is a Next.js-based bookmark management application that demonstrates the integration of Model Context Protocol (MCP) with Clerk's authentication system. The application allows users to create, read, and delete bookmarks through both a traditional web interface and programmatic MCP tools, showcasing how AI assistants can interact with authenticated web applications through standardized protocols.

The project serves as a practical implementation of MCP's capabilities, enabling AI tools like Cursor to directly interact with user data through authenticated API endpoints while maintaining security through Clerk's OAuth-based authentication flow.

## Key Features

- **MCP Server Implementation**: Exposes get-user-bookmarks and create-bookmark tools for AI assistant integration through Cursor or Claude Desktop
- **Clerk MCP Authentication**: Implements OAuth 2.0 protected resource endpoints with proper token verification (HAS A TON OF VERY HELPFUL DOCUMENTATION!)
- **Secure User Isolation**: Each user's bookmarks are protected and accessible only with proper authentication through Clerk login
- **Real-time CRUD Operations**: Full bookmark management with various functionalities like create, read, and delete
- **Prisma Database Integration**: Type-safe database operations with SQLite backend

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js 15**: Full-stack React framework with API routes and server-side rendering
- **Cursor**: AI-powered code editor that can interact with the MCP server endpoints
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: Protocol enabling AI assistants to securely access application data
- **Clerk**: Authentication provider with specialized MCP OAuth implementation
- **Prisma**: Clean & nice with various utilities and compatibility with databases like SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.

## Challenges and Learnings

- Implementing OAuth 2.0 flow specifically designed for MCP tool authentication
- Configuring MCP metadata endpoints for service discovery by AI tools
- Understanding the distinction between traditional web auth and MCP-specific authentication patterns
- Debugging token verification and scope management for protected MCP resources
- Learned about the uniqe differences between REST APIs and MCPs (when to use which one!)

## Outcome

Overall, learning MCPs is definitely useful and interesting, but its primarily used for attaching an LLM like Cursor or Claude Desktop to a local project. Getting AI assistance or running commands through an LLM to implement features within your local program has a ton of applications, but its most of all a quality of life thing for developers to get easy and fast answers to certain things within the project.
