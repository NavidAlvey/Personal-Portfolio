# Overview

This personal portfolio is a web app representation of my resume; providing a more comprehensive showcase of my professional journey as a software engineer. Details that get cut out from the resume of general online applications are shown in greater depth within this project since it features a modern and response web app design. Using Next.js, Node, & React, I've been able to compile my personality, character, and background into one spot; highlighting work experiences and projects as well as personal snapshots of my life.

I've used more than just basic HTML, CSS, & JavaScript. Instead, I've employed more advanced web development practices and frameworks, such as: server-side rendering, dynamic routing, SEO optimization, & response design principles. Learning about modern web dev and how some of the biggest companies in the world portray themselves online has been a great insipiration for how I wanted my personal portfolio to be.

# Challenges and Learnings

Creating a cohesive user experience that effectively balances professional presentation with personal character served to be more challenging than I had originally thought. Determining what elements and components to add to the website was definitely took some planning since I needed to prioritze certain elements such as experiences & technology tools over things like hobbies (this is for a professional career page afterall, not a Pintrest). Majority what I had originally envisioned was possible due to NextJS flexibile components as well as getting help from online resources & documentation to bring my concepts to life.

Learning about the system architecture of a NextJS & Node web app was really interesting since many components come pre-loaded, simply waiting to be customized to my specifications. This project provided valuable experience in modern web dev, UI/UX skills, and overall CI/CD & SDLC best practices. Additionally modern web dev has so much more to just building a nice looking UI; SEO optimization, metadata management, and structures of search engine crawlers are niche tools/skills that aren't really taught in a classroom. 

# Outcome

Overall, I'm really happy with how this project came out since it has definitely provided me at least a base website to further build upon and add to as I grow as a person. My favorite aspects of this website are definitely the About Me and Gallery pages since it has the most unique characterization of myself - with all the photos and special details I'm able to add that people wouldn't see on my resume. I'm excited to finally deploy this project into production and hope to share my portfolio to the world (especially recruiters!) and display who I am.
