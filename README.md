# Navid Alvey's Personal Portfolio

If you're seeing this, welcome to my portfolio's code base. To start off, the READMe file is just a general overview of the actual project itself. Theres some photos (and probably video demos if I get to it tbh) that will show you the general layout of the website itself. If for whatever reason you've come to the GitHub first, go to the actual website and check it out (I didn't put all my time and effort into building it for nothing!). 

I'll be adding more content to it like personal highlights from Yelp & Spotify but also RANKED LISTS of various topics like foods, restaurants, books, movies, games, etc. Just some more personal details & hobbies that could show more character outside of work, work, & work.
